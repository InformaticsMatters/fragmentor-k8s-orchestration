Ansible playbooks for the Kubernetes-based execution of [fragmentor]
**Playbooks**.

Before you attempt to execute any fragmentation plays...

1.  You will need a Kubernetes cluster with a ReadWriteMany storage class
    (i.e. NFS or, if using AWS, EFS)
2.  You will need a Kubernetes namespace that contains a pre-deployed postgres
    server, by default the namespace is expected to be called `fragmentor`.
    You can use the Ansible playbook and role in our [postgresql-ansible]
    GitHub repository to create the namespace and install a PostgreSQL
    database (See the **Kubernetes namespace setup** section below).
3.  The database needs to be using a shareable (EFS/NFS) volume
    (`ReadWriteMany`) for use with **pgcopy** command data - and you'll need
    the name of the PVC. This is expected to be mounted into the database at
    `/pgcopy`.
4.  You will need at least 10 spare cores available and 8Gi of RAM in the
    cluster to satisfy the needs of the database and player Pods.
5.  The database server needs a user (`fragmentor`) with SUPERUSER privilege
    and a database (`fairmolecules`)
6.  The database service is expected to be exposed by a **Service**
    called `postgres`
7.  Your cluster must contain nodes with the label
    `informaticsmatters.com/purpose=core` as the database Pod will require
    a node with this label during scheduling
8.  Your cluster must contain nodes with the label
    `informaticsmatters.com/purpose=fragmentor`. The fragmentor (Nextflow)
    containers will only run on nodes that contain this label. Each fragmentor
    node must have at least 4 cores and 8Gi RAM.
9.  You will need an AWS bucket that holds your vendor molecule data.
    This bucket will also be used for the delivery of the extracted
    fragmentation/graph data.
10. You will need your Kubernetes config file.
11. You will need AWS credentials (that allow for bucket access).

## Kubernetes namespace setup
You can conveniently create the required namespace and database using our
[postgresql-ansible] Ansible playbooks.

>   You will need to decide now how much disk space you need to
    give your database. There are volumes for the main database
    and ReadWriteMany volume for 'pgcopy' actions.

Start from the project root of a clone of the repository: -

    $ python -m venv venv

    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

...and create the database and corresponding namespace using an Ansible
YAML-based parameter file. Here's an example that should work for 'small'
fragmentation exercises (a few thousand molecules) on a typical AWS
cluster: -

```yaml
---
pg_namespace: fragmentor
pg_aux_user: fragmentor
pg_aux_user_password: bullfinch
pg_aux_database: fairmolecules
pg_copy_vol_size_g: 5
pg_copy_vol_storageclass: efs
pg_vol_size_g: 5
pg_vol_storageclass: gp2
pg_cpu_request: 4
pg_cpu_limit: 8
pg_mem_request: 2Gi
pg_mem_limit: 4Gi
```

>   Your fragmentation stages may require additional postgres configuration
    in order to function properly (which typically relates to working memory
    and cores/processes). If this is so then you can provide an 'additional'
    postgres configuration file and name this using the
    playbook's `pg_extra_configuration_file` variable.

You will need to set a few Kubernetes variables...

    $ export K8S_AUTH_HOST=https://example.com
    $ export K8S_AUTH_API_KEY=1234
    $ export K8S_AUTH_VERIFY_SSL=no

Then run the playbook...

    $ ansible-playbook site.yaml -e @parameters.yaml
    [...]

## Running a fragmentor play
the _player_ Pod (implemented in and released from the [fragmentor] repository)
provides a series of Ansible playbooks for each stage of fragmentation: -

-   **standardise**
-   **fragment**
-   **inchi**
-   **extract**
-   **combine**

All of these playbooks are available in the _player_ container in Kubernetes,
launched by this repo's playbook. What this repository's playbook does is
launch the _player_ container (in a pre-existing Kubernetes **Namespace**)
as a **Job**, mapping Ansible playbook parameters into the container prior
to its execution. It sets an environment in the _player_ that is used to
select the play that is run.

To run a play you must set a set of play-specific parameters in the local file
`parameters.yaml`. Once you've defined these you can run the _player_.

Start from a virtual environment: -

    $ python -m venv venv

    $ source venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

As always, set a few key environment parameters: -

    $ export K8S_AUTH_HOST=https://example.com
    $ export K8S_AUTH_API_KEY=?????
    $ export K8S_AUTH_VERIFY_SSL=no

    $ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config

For access to AWS S3: -

    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=?????
    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=?????

You _name_ the play to run using our playbook's `fp_play` variable.
In this example we're running the *database reset* play and setting
the storage class to `nfs`: -

    $ ansible-playbook site-player.yaml \
        -e fp_play=db-server-configure_create-database \
        -e fp_work_volume_storageclass=nfs

As individual plays can take a considerable time to run the `site-player`
playbook does not wait for the result - you need to
inspect the _player_ Pod yourself to check on the its progress.

>   The player will prevent you from running another _play_ while
    one still appears to be running.

## Cheat-sheet
With a `parameter.yaml` file like the following in your project directory
(which expects to find xchem/dsip data in your bucket) you should be able to
run a sequence of plays.

>   The parameter filename is assumed - if you use a different
    filename you will need to add `-e fp_parameter_file=myfile.yaml` to the
    playbook examples below.

>   You will need to provide the name of the AWS S3 bucket that you're
    using to store RAW vendor data and extracted results. Here we're using the
    bucket `im-fragnet` but (as these names are global you wil need to replace
    it with the name of your bucket.

```yaml
---
database_login_host: postgres
deployment: production
bucket: im-fragnet
runpath: /work
add_backup: no
vendor: xchem_dsip
version: v1
extracts:
- lib:
    vendor: xchem_dsip
    version: v1
    regenerate_index: yes
hardware:
  production:
    parallel_jobs: 8
    cluster_cores: 8
    sort_memory: 4GB
    postgres_jobs: 8
```

-   **Reset fragmentation database**

>   This must be done once, and only once, prior to running any fragmentation
    plays. It formats the database by adding key tables and seeds then
    with key records.

```
    $ ansible-playbook site-player.yaml \
        -e fp_play=db-server-configure_create-database
```

-   **Standardise**

```
    $ ansible-playbook site-player.yaml -e fp_play=standardise
```

-   **Fragment**

```
    $ ansible-playbook site-player.yaml -e fp_play=fragment
```

-   **InChi**

```
    $ ansible-playbook site-player.yaml -e fp_play=inchi
```

-   **Extract** (a dataset to graph CSV files)

```
    $ ansible-playbook site-player.yaml -e fp_play=extract
```

-   **Combine** (multiple datasets into graph CSV files)

Using a slightly modified parameter file (shown below) you can then combine
fragmented datasets.

```yaml
---
database_login_host: postgres
deployment: production
bucket: im-fragnet
runpath: /work
add_backup: no
vendor: xchem_dsip
version: v1
extracts:
- lib:
    path: extract/xchem_dsip/v1
    data_source: s3
    bucket: im-fragnet
    aws_access_key: ?????
    aws_secret_key: ?????
- lib:
    path: extract/xchem_spot/v1
    data_source: s3
    bucket: im-fragnet
    aws_access_key: ?????
    aws_secret_key: ?????
path_out: xchem_combi_alan_20201117
data_source_out: s3
hardware:
  production:
    parallel_jobs: 8
    cluster_cores: 8
    sort_memory: 4GB
    postgres_jobs: 8
```

```
    $ ansible-playbook site-player.yaml -e fp_play=combine
```

## A convenient player query playbook
If you don't have visual access to the cluster you can run
the following playbook, which summarises the phase of the currently executing
play. It will tell you if the current play is still running.

    $ ansible-playbook site-player_query.yaml

It finishes with a summary message like this: -

```
TASK [player : Display query message] *****************************************
Wednesday 18 November 2020  13:17:54 +0000 (0:00:00.049)       0:00:07.401 ****
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": "The 'standardise' play is running"
}
```

## Killing the player (not recommended)
If the player is failing, and you want to kill it, and the Job that
launched it, you can run the kill-player playbook: -

    $ ansible-playbook site-player_kill-player.yaml
